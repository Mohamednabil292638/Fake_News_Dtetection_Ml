📰 Fake News Detection using Deep Learning (Logistic Regression)
This project aims to detect fake news articles using Logistic Regression, a machine learning model. It analyzes text data to classify news as either real or fake, helping to combat misinformation.

📌 Features
Preprocessing of text data (removal of stopwords, punctuation, etc.).
Feature extraction using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
Classification using Logistic Regression.
Performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, and recall.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains labeled news articles as fake or real.
You can download the dataset from Kaggle.

📊 Model Training & Evaluation
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared text data.
Feature Extraction: Converted text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF.
Model Used: Logistic Regression (a deep learning-based classification model).
Performance Metrics: Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
🛠 How to Run the Project
Run the Python script to train and test the model:
bash
Copy
Edit
python fake_news_detection.py
The model will classify input news as Real or Fake.
📌 Results
Achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test dataset.
Successfully differentiates between real and fake news.
